# Bustling-Books
Problem: Design a web app that allows Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities students to easily buy and sell used books.

Solution: I  propose to make a simple, sober yet effective web and mobile app (Bustling Books) that is able to solve all the problems of different user types and is able to cater to all user actions.

Why It is better than any existing Solution:
Bustling Books will connect the interested sellers and buyers.
Bustling Books will connect like-minded people.
Bustling Books will help people Ô¨Ånd better deals (Buyer/Sellers).
Bustling Books will help to contribute to a cause when a lot of books were going into the garbage where they can now be used by someone who really needs it.
Bustling Books will open opportunities for people to build networks/collections and make small revenues for themselves.
